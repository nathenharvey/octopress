    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the big themes that emerged during <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com/">#ChefConf</a> was that we should be testing our infrastructure code.  Software engineers have been practicing test-driven development, behavior-driven development, continuous integration, and many other testing-related practices for a long time.  It's becoming more important for the infrastructure engineers to learn from and apply these practices to our day-to-day workflow.  When it comes to testing Chef-driven infrastructure automation, there are a number of tools and practices that are starting to emerge.  In this article I'll look a "minimum viable testing" (MVT) approach to this problem using <a href="http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/">Foodcritic</a> and <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>.  Follow the steps in this article to get your public cookbooks tested after every <code>git push</code></p>

<h3>Testing with Chef</h3>

<p>The idea of building automated tests for your infrastructure code has been getting a lot of traction lately.  When it comes to <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>, many tools are starting to emerge.</p>

<p>The first tool in this area to get any significant traction, that I know of, was <a href="http://www.cucumber-chef.org/">cucumber-chef</a>.  I first learned of this tool when I saw a pre-release copy of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020042.do">Test-Driven Infrastructure with Chef</a> at the O'Reilly booth at <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011">Velocity Conf 2011</a>.  <a href="http://twitter.com/lordcope">Stephen Nelson-Smith</a>, the book's author and framework's lead developer, proposes an outside-in approach to testing where your tests can also act as monitors that look after the health of your infrastructure.  I like the idea of this approach and feel it makes a lot of sense in a greenfield environment.  In my particular situation this doesn't feel like the most appropriate way to start testing our infrastructure.  The blurring of testing and monitoring is appealing.  In fact, we typically practice what we call "monitoring-driven development."  When provisioning a new application server, for example, we wait until our monitors have validated the health of the server before adding the server to our load balancer.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec">ChefSpec</a> is another tool for testing your Chef code.  It is a gem that makes it easy to write <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> examples for Chef cookbooks.  This style of testing allows you to execute your tests without needing to converge the node that your tests are running on.  In other words, you can execute your tests without needing to provision a server.  One huge appeal to this style of testing is that the feedback loop is very small.  You'll get feedback about your cookbook changes within seconds or a very few minutes of saving your changes.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/calavera/minitest-chef-handler">Minitest Chef Handler</a> is yet another tool for testing with Chef.  This runs a suite of <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">minitest</a> tests as a report handler in your Chef-managed nodes.  As you may know, report handlers are run at the end of each <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Anatomy+of+a+Chef+Run">chef run, or convergence</a>.</p>

<h3>Testing at ChefConf</h3>

<p>At the inaugural <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf</a> there were many sessions that included information about many companies' approach to testing.  Here's a quick list of some of the sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/04/episode-10-testallthethings-testing.html">Food Fight Show Episode #10 - TESTALLTHETHINGS</a> -- This wasn't actually part of #ChefConf but is 'required listening' for anyone interested in learning more about this space.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chefconf2012.sched.org/event/bfe13edac99e2b4d8582f0cd1005ee73?iframe=no&amp;w=700&amp;sidebar=no&amp;bg=no">#ChefConf Pre-event Hackday: TEST ALL THE THINGS!!!</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/atomic-penguin/ntp">NTP Cookbook with tests</a> - tests were added to this cookbook as part of the hackday event.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2e0aZUAVGw">Test-driven Development for Chef Practitioners</a> (video)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPaYfAIvqxw">Test Driven Development Roundtable</a> (video)</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Foodcritic</h3>

<p><a href="http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/">Foodcritic</a> is a lint tool for your Chef cookbooks.</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Foodcritic has two goals:</p></p><p><ul><br/><li><p>To make it easier to flag problems in your Chef cookbooks that will cause Chef to blow up when you attempt to converge. This is about faster feedback. If you automate checks for common problems you can save a lot of time.</p></li><br/><li><p>To encourage discussion within the Chef community on the more subjective stuff - what does a good cookbook look like? Opscode have avoided being overly prescriptive which by and large I think is a good thing. Having a set of rules to base discussion on helps drive out what we as a community think is good style.</p></blockquote></p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Travis CI</h3>

<p>Travis CI is</p>

<p><blockquote><p>A hosted continuous integration service for the open source community.</p></blockquote></p>

<h3>Automated Foodcritic tests with Travis CI</h3>

<p>Using Foodcritic and Travis CI, you can quickly set-up a "minimum viable testing" (MVT) environment.  The idea is that once you have some sort of tests running against your cookbooks, you'll want to add more and doing so will be easy.  Let's look at how to add Foodcritic and Travis CI to your cookbook workflow.</p>

<h4>Initial set-up</h4>

<p>Follow these steps to get everything set-up and ready for your first tests:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>gem install foodcritic</code></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> and follow the Sign In link at the top.</li>
<li>Activate the GitHub Service Hook for your cookbook's repository from your TravisCI profile page.  Each of your cookbooks has its own repository, right?!</li>
</ol>


<h4>Configure your project</h4>

<p>The next step is to add a .travis.yml file to your project.</p>

<p><code>ruby .travis.yml
language: ruby
gemfile:
   - test/support/Gemfile
rvm:
  - 1.9.2
  - 1.9.3
script: BUNDLE_GEMFILE=test/support/Gemfile bundle exec rake foodcritic
</code></p>

<p>This file tells Travis CI how to build your project.  We've specified the language (ruby) and the versions of ruby to use when testing this cookbook (1.9.2 and 1.9.3).  We've also specified a Gemfile and script to execute when testing this project.  Let's add a Gemfile to a new directory in our cookbook, <code>test/support</code>.</p>

<p><code>sh
mkdir -p test/support
touch test/support/Gemfile
</code></p>

<p>Our Gemfile is pretty simple, just include <code>rake</code> and <code>foodcritic</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"</p>

<p>gem 'rake'
gem 'foodcritic'
```</p>

<p>Finally, we'll need to add a Rake file that will be run each time Travis builds our project.</p>

<p>``` ruby Rakefile</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/env rake</h1>

<p>desc "Runs foodcritic linter"
task :foodcritic do
  if Gem::Version.new("1.9.2") &lt;= Gem::Version.new(RUBY_VERSION.dup)</p>

<pre><code>sandbox = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), %w{tmp foodcritic cookbook})
prepare_foodcritic_sandbox(sandbox)

sh "foodcritic --epic-fail any #{File.dirname(sandbox)}"
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>puts "WARN: foodcritic run is skipped as Ruby #{RUBY_VERSION} is &lt; 1.9.2."
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>task :default => 'foodcritic'</p>

<p>private</p>

<p>def prepare_foodcritic_sandbox(sandbox)
  files = %w{<em>.md </em>.rb attributes definitions files providers
recipes resources templates}</p>

<p>  rm_rf sandbox
  mkdir_p sandbox
  cp_r Dir.glob("{#{files.join(',')}}"), sandbox
  puts "\n\n"
end
```</p>

<p>This Rakefile will copy the contents of our cookbook to a temporary directory and run the foodcritic tests on the temporary directory.  Note the <code>--epic-fail</code> tag is used to fail the build (return a non-zero exit code) on <code>any</code> rule that does not pass.</p>

<p>That's it!  When you push your commit to github, you should see Travis CI pick-up the changes, run your build, and report on status.</p>

<h3>Share Your Build Status</h3>

<p>One final step that you may consider is adding a build status indicator to your README.  This simple line in your README will let others know what the current build status is for your cookbook.</p>

<p><code>
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].png)](http://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME])
</code></p>

<h3>Thanks &amp; Additional Resources</h3>

<p>A big "Thank You!" shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/fnichol">Fletcher Nichol</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/atomic_penguin">Eric G. Wolfe</a> from whom I 'borrowed' the <code>Rakefile</code> and <code>.travis.yml</code> used in this post.</p>

    <link href="http://www.nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-02T16:59:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/green-screen/">previous post</a>, I introduced <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">Green Screen</a>, a build monitoring tool that is designed to be used as a dynamic Big Visible Chart (BVC) in your work area.  It lets you add links to your build servers and displays the largest possible information on a monitor so that the team can see the build status from anywhere in the room.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to get <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">Green Screen</a> up and running on your own server or VM. The project's <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen/blob/master/README.md">README</a> includes all the information you'll need for doing so. In this post, I'll describe the steps necessary to run Green Screen on Heroku or on your own server using Chef.</p>

<h2>Deploying to Heroku</h2>

<p>Deploying to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is probably the easiest way to get up and running with Green Screen. You'll need a Heroku account but a free one should be sufficient. Check the <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart">quick start guide</a> if you don't yet have an account.</p>

<p>Once you've got your Heroku account set-up, simply follow these steps to get your Green Screen app deployed:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:customink/greenscreen.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd greenscreen</code></li>
<li><code>gem install heroku</code></li>
<li><code>heroku create</code></li>
<li><code>git push heroku master</code></li>
<li><code>heroku open</code></li>
</ol>


<p>If your build servers are running on the Internet, Heroku may be all that you need.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong> this default Green Screen looks at all of the builds currently running on <a href="http://ci.jenkins-ci.org">http://ci.jenkins-ci.org</a>.  This is fine for demo purposes but you may find it to be a bit overwhelming since it's <strong>over 300 builds</strong> at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>You can see a sample of this app running at <a href="http://greenscreenapp.com">http://greenscreenapp.com</a></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Deploying with Chef</h2>

<p>If your build servers are not publicly accessible, Heroku won't be a great option. <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> has published a <a href="http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/greenscreen">Chef cookbook</a> for setting up Green Screen on one of your nodes.</p>

<p>You simply need to include the greenscreen recipe to install, configure, and run one or more GreenScreen applications.  Or add it to your role, or directly to a node's recipes.</p>

<p><code>ruby
include_recipe "greenscreen"
</code></p>

<p>Of course, if you're just getting started with Chef, you should look at <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> which is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments. With Vagrant, you can quickly spin-up a VM in <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and have it use the greenscreen cookbook.</p>

<p>The cookbook allows you to specify credentials and jobs to include or ignore with each server and allows you to set-up multiple Green Screens on the same node. At CustomInk, we use different Green Screen applications for different teams.</p>

<p>Here's an excerpt from one of our Chef environment files:</p>

<p>``` ruby
"greenscreens" => [
  {</p>

<pre><code>:name =&gt; "greenscreen",
:port =&gt; "4567",
:servers =&gt; [
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build01.customink.office:8080/cc.xml"
  },
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build02.customink.office:8080/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "hudson",
    :password =&gt; "hudson_password"
  },
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build03.customink.office:8080/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "hudson",
    :password =&gt; "hudson_password",
    :ignore_jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>  },
  {</p>

<pre><code>:name =&gt; "greenscreen.webops",
:port =&gt; "4568",
:servers =&gt; [
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build03.customink.office:8080/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "hudson",
    :password =&gt; "hudson_password",
    :jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]
  },
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build04.customink.office/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "jenkins",
    :password =&gt; "jenkis_password"
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>  }
]
```</p>

<p>With this configuration, we have 2 Green Screens running, on ports 4567 and 4568. Both are polling build servers and showing different jobs. For instance, the server on 4567 excludes the www_redirects build (<code>:ignore_jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]</code>) whereas the server on 4568 only includes this build (<code>:jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]</code>) when polling the build03 server.</p>

We use Green Screen at <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> to look after our continuous integration servers, currently 3 Hudson servers and one Jenkins cluster. We have a monitor mounted in the engineering office that makes it easy for everyone to quickly assess the build status.</p>

<p>Green Screen is a simple Sinatra application that is <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen">easy to configure and deploy</a>.  It works well with any continuous integration server that conforms to the <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CI/Multiple+Project+Summary+Reporting+Standard">multiple project summary reporting standard</a>.</p>

<p>You can see a sample Green Screen app running at <a href="http://greenscreenapp.com">http://greenscreenapp.com</a>.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Green Screen was originally implemented by <a href="https://github.com/martinjandrews">Marty Andrews</a> and <a href="http://blog.martyandrews.net/2009/08/greenscreen-build-monitor-bvc.html">announced on his blog in 2009</a>. In the original version, a build that was in progress would blink on the screen.
<a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4565_building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4565_building.jpg" width="208" height="145" title="martinjandrews Green Screen" alt="martinjandrews Green Screen"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rsutphin">Rhett Sutphin</a> improved the layout of green screen and introduced a new color, yellow, for builds that are in progress.
<a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4566-building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4566-building.jpg" width="207" height="145" title="rsutphin Green Screen" alt="rsutphin Green Screen"></a></p>

<p>After using these versions for a while at CustomInk, we decided that the most important thing to know was which builds were failing. Once you get past a handful of builds, it's no longer very interesting to see every build. We forked Rhett's version and created a <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">new layout for Green Screen</a>.</p>

<p>If everything is passing, the screen is basically one giant checkmark.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/green.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/green.jpg" width="210" height="119" title="customink Green Screen" alt="customink Green Screen"></a></p>

<p>If there are any failing builds, they're shown in the main area while all others are displayed on the right.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567.jpg" width="210" height="121" title="customink failed build" alt="customink failed build"></a></p>

<p>Finally, a build that previously failed will be shown in yellow while it's rebuilding.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567_building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567_building.jpg" width="210" height="121" title="customink building" alt="customink building">
</a>
We've also added support for controlling which builds are displayed from each CI server. So that you can explicitly include or exclude builds or just go with the default behavior of showing all builds on the server.</p>

<h2>Deploying</h2>

<p>I'll cover a couple of deployment options for Green Screen in my <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen">next post</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a>, we recently migrated from mongrel to Passenger for our Ruby on Rails website. This migration included a full rewrite of our apache configuration files.</p>

<p>With over 500 redirect and rewrite rules in place I needed a way to ensure my copy-n-paste skills were up to snuff and that we didn't loose any redirects along the way.</p>

<p>In my search for help, I found a <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/test-drive-mod-rewrite-rules-with-testunit/">blog post by Patrick Reagan from Viget labs</a> that described a method for writing tests that will verify all the rewrite rules and redirects. Patrick's ideas were packaged up into a gem and available on <a href="http://github.com/eightbitraptor/http_redirect_test">github</a>.</p>

<p>I can now write up tests like:</p>

<p><code>ruby
should_redirect "/cink/ideas/ideas.jsp", :to =&gt; "/inspiration/"
</code></p>

<p>So now I can to some TDC (test-driven configuration) whenever I get a request for a new redirect.</p>

<p>What other methods have you used to test your rewrite rules?</p>
