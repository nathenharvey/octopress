I've recently switched my blog from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) to [Octopress](http://octopress.org). After working with Blogger, WordPress, and TypePad I've found that the Octopress works best for my personal blog.

Creating and editing posts in a text editor instead of a browser is a step-saver for me.  Previously I always worked with a local copy of each article and would cut-n-paste between my text editor and the browser.

The rake- and git-based workflow feels very natural.  After all, this is a "blogging framework for hackers."

The standard layout and plugins are working well for me with little customization.

Deploying is a snap. I'm currently using [Heroku](http://heroku.com) to host the blog but could just as easily be using [github:pages](http://pages.github.com/).

The simplicity and familiar workflow really make for an excellent blogging platform! Thanks [@imathis](http://twitter.com/imathis) for giving us [Octopress](http://octopress.org)!
